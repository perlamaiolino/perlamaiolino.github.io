# Research

My work focuses on tactile sensing and embodied intelligence for robotics, bridging sensing hardware, control, and real-world interaction.

## Current directions
- Soft robotic sensing and tactile skins
- Proxi-tactile sensing for safe interaction
- Embodied learning and task-driven design
- Tactile simulation and evaluation
