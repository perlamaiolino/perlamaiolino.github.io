I am an Associate Professor at the University of Oxford (ORI) and a Tutorial Fellow in Engineering at the Brasenose College. I am also Deputy Director of the Oxford Robotics Institute (ORI) and PI of the Soft Robotics Lab at ORI. 

I work on tactile sensing, soft robotics, and embodied intelligence, bridging sensing hardware, control, and real-world robotic physical interaction.
