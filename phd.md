I supervise PhD students working on tactile sensing, soft robotics, and embodied intelligence.
Please check [SRL website](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/srl/research-soft-robotics) to check ongoing research themes and [publications](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/srl/soft-robotics-publications) in my group.

My group is small, and I work closely with students, so research fit and motivation are essential.

Due to the limited availability of funded positions (see below), I am only able to consider a small number of candidates each year.

## What I look for
I look for candidates who:

- are genuinely curious about research (not just applications or trends),
- have a solid engineering or scientific foundation,
- are comfortable with uncertainty and failure,
- are willing to put sustained effort into difficult problems.

A PhD in my group is demanding and not suitable for everyone. 

Please note that due to the volume of requests **I am not able to reply to individual emails about PhD opportunities**.

If you are still excited about joining my team:

1 Apply through the formal university process (e.g. DPhil/MRes/CDTs) indicating me as supervisor, and
2 Complete the [short form](https://forms.gle/Whzm9LK7c9n1wnot8) that is designed to help both you and me assess whether this is a good fit.

**Applications or emails that do not follow this process will not be considered.**
